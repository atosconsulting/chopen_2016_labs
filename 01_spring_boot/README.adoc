= LAB 01: Getting Started with Spring Boot and Kotlin

In this lab we will write our first REST resource using `spring-boot` and `Kotlin` language. The goal is to make `TableResourceTest.kt` pass.

== Steps

. Implement `TableResource` which is a Spring `@RestController` (have a look https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/[here] for more details)
.. Create a new class or embed it directly in the `Application.kt`
.. It should have one method exposed under `/tables` URI which returns list of IDs when `GET` is called
.. Run `TableResourceTest` from your IDE (or by invoking `./gradlew build`) to prove it works
. Start your microservice as a regular Java process and invoke `$ curl -i 'http://localhost:8080/tables'`
