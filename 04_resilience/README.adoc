= LAB 04: Don't panic!

In this lab we see how fault tolerance is implemented by Hystrix. We will need to provide a fallback method to make the `OrderResourceTest` pass.

== Steps

. Implement fallback method which will simply response with `accepted()` status
. Bind it as fallback for Hystrix (http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/spring-cloud-netflix.html[have a look here if in doubt])
. Check if the test is green
